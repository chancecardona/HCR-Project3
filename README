Code created by Chance Cardona.
To run code simply type:
    python3 skeleton_data.py

The code should take care of the rest and use the training data directory provided
in this package to generate rad_d1, rad_d1.t, cust_d1, and cust_d1.t frequency data
in space separated format. Note python will generate empty files. Must run as python3.
All histograms are generated with numpy's histogram with default
settings. The cust format returns a 2x5 matrix for each sample as well, but measures
different distances and angles I figured would be helpful such as hand to hand
angle/distance, and extremety distance/angle relative to knees/elbows and hip/shoulder.
